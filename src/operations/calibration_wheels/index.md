# Calibration - Wheels

```{needget}
You can make your robot move
---
You can calibrate the wheels of the Duckiebot such that it goes in a straight line
when commanded so. You can set the maximum speed of the Duckiebot.
```

````{note}
In the following documentation on this page, `[hostname]` refers to the hostname of your duckiebot. For example:

```
ping [hostname].local
```

with a Duckiebot named `myrobot` would be:

```
ping myrobot.local
```

Also, replace other fields in a command with `[]` around with the corresponding values.

````

## Step 1: Make your robot move

Follow instructions in [](rc-control) to make your robot move with keyboard control, and keep the terminal open. 

## Step 2: See how the robot really moves

There is a lot going on between pressing <kbd>&#x21e7;</kbd> (up arrow) on the keyboard and your Duckiebot moving. To get a better view of what is going on, we need another terminal, but ran closer to where the action is happening:

```
dts start_gui_tools [hostname]
```

Duckietown uses [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) to move data around. To determine if the command above worked, type:

```
rostopic list
```

You should see a list of ROS _topics_ currently active on your Duckiebot. If you know ROS, here you can use ROS commands at will. If you are not familiar with ROS, note that each of these _topics_ might carry _messages_, i.e., actual data. You can, e.g., "listen" to the data inside each topic. For example:


```
rostopic echo /[hostname]/camera_node/image/compressed
```

will show you incoming images as the Duckiebot sees them! You won't be able to read bytes or make sense of pixel values, though. Now, press `Ctrl+C` to stop reading the camera stream.

:::{note}
Keep this terminal open. We will use it to perform the wheel calibration. All the `ros...` commands below are executed in such a terminal.

## Step 3: Perform the calibration

### Calibrating the `trim` parameter

The trim parameter is set to `0.00` by default, under the assumption that both motors and wheels are perfectly identical. You can change the value of the trim parameter by running the command (in the `start_gui_tools` terminal from the previous step):

```
rosparam set /[hostname]/kinematics_node/trim [trim_value]
```

Use some tape to create a straight line on the floor ({numref}`fig:wheel_calibration_line`).

```{figure} ../../_images/duckiebot_assembly_and_setup/calibration_wheels/wheel_calibration_line.jpg
:width: 30em
:name: fig:wheel_calibration_line

Straight line useful for wheel calibration
```

Place your Duckiebot on one end of the tape.
Make sure that the Duckiebot is perfectly centered with respect to the line.

Command your Duckiebot to go straight for about 2 meters.
Observe the Duckiebot from the point where it started moving,
and annotate on which side of the tape the Duckiebot drifted ({numref}`fig:wheel_calibration_lr_drift`).

```{figure} ../../_images/duckiebot_assembly_and_setup/calibration_wheels/wheel_calibration_lr_drift.jpg
:width: 30em
:name: fig:wheel_calibration_lr_drift

Left/Right drift
```

Measure the distance between the center of the tape and the center of the axle of
the Duckiebot after it traveled for about 2 meters ({numref}`fig:wheel_calibration_measuring_drift`).

Make sure that the ruler is orthogonal to the tape.

```{figure} ../../_images/duckiebot_assembly_and_setup/calibration_wheels/wheel_calibration_measuring_drift.jpg
:width: 30em
:name: fig:wheel_calibration_measuring_drift

Measure the amount of drift after 2 meters run
```

If the Duckiebot drifted by less than `10` centimeters you can stop calibrating the trim parameter.
A drift of `10` centimeters in a `2` meters run is good enough for Duckietown.
If the Duckiebot drifted by more than `10` centimeters, continue with the next step.

If the Duckiebot drifted to the left side of the tape, decrease the value of `r`, by running, for example:

```
rosparam set /[hostname]/kinematics_node/trim -0.1
```

If the Duckiebot drifted to the right side of the tape, increase the value of `r`, by running, for example:

```
rosparam set /[hostname]/kinematics_node/trim 0.1
```

Repeat this process until the robot drives straight.


### Calibrating the `gain` parameter

The gain parameter is set to `1.00` by default. You can change its value by
running the command:

```
rosparam set /[hostname]/kinematics_node/gain [gain_value]
```

### Store the calibration

When you are all done, save the parameters by running:

```
rosservice call /[hostname]/kinematics_node/save_calibration
```

The first time you save the parameters, this command will create the calibration file


### Final check to make sure it's stored

The calibration result is saved on your Duckiebot:

```
/data/config/calibrations/kinematics/[hostname].yaml
```

You can view or download the calibration file using the Dashboard running at `http://[hostname].local` under `File Manager` in the sidebar on the left, navigating to `config/calibrations/kinematics/`.


### Additional information

There are additional parameters you can to play around with to get a better driving experience.
