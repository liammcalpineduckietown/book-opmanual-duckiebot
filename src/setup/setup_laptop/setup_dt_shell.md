The Duckietown Shell is a [command-line interface (CLI) program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) 
that provides all of the necessary Duckietown operations, such as
* Updating a Duckiebot
* Driving a Duckiebot with a virtual keyboard
* Viewing the camera stream of a Duckiebot from a graphical app
* Using our learning experiences
* (and more!)

(laptop-setup-ubuntu-shell)=
**1) Install the Duckietown Shell (`dts`)**

Install the Duckietown Shell using the following command,

    pip3 install --no-cache-dir --user --upgrade duckietown-shell


**2) Source `dts`**

Make sure your system can find local binaries by adding the following to your `.bashrc` file. 

```{attention}
If you are using `zsh`, replace the `.bashrc` in the commands below with `.zshrc` instead.
```

    export PATH=~/.local/bin:${PATH}

Then source the updates to your current shell or restart your shell.

    source ~/.bashrc

---

**Checkpoint ✅**

To confirm that `dts` was installed successfully, run the following test

```{testexpect}
```bash
which dts
---
This should output a path ending in `dts`.
```
